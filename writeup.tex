\section{Introduction}

% A description of the purpose, goals, and scope of your system or
% empirical investigation.  You should include references to papers you
% read on which your project and any algorithms you used are
% based. Include a discussion of whether you adapted a published
% algorithm or devised a new one, the range of problems and issues you
% addressed, and the relation of these problems and issues to the
% techniques and ideas covered in the course.

This project was a technical study of the game ``Flappy Bird'' (FB) through the lens
of artificial intelligence. Using both deterministic and randomized paths,
we represented FB as both an informed search problem and a Q-Learning process.
Adopting the obvious end of maximizing the game's score as our agent's learning goal,
we approached this problem in three phases. First, we adapted an open source version
of this project into an interface conducive to AI work, redefining the game to be
comprised of familiar objects like states, goals, rewards, successors, and the other
necessary underlying factors. Second, we devised an informed search solution to the problem.
This involved requring the agent to solve a game with deterministic pipes, i.e.,
to figure out an action set that guides the agent through each pipe successfully.
We used the A* algorithm in this phase, with carefully designed heuristic that
served to break the larger problem into subproblems, with the agent only needing
to find a path between one pair of pipes at a time. The final phase of the project
was to relax the constraint of determinism in the pipes and to require the agent
to solve a game ``as it comes''. This involved a shift in paradigm, reforming
the game as an offline policy learning problem rather than as a search problem.
Our results were uniformly positive, with the AI-representation of the game serving
us well, the informed search algorithms able to solve large generated games in
quasilinear time, and the policy derived from Q-learning successful outperforming
any reasonable human.\\\\
This project was a true capstone to our study in this course. From proofs of
heuristic admissibility in informed search to extensive optimization of the policy
derivation algorithm in the Q-learning section, we engaged deeply with the core
tenets of the course throughout our work.


\section{Background and Related Work}



\section{Problem Specification}

A clear description of the problem you are solving in both general terms
and how you've mapped it to a formal problem specification.


\section{Approach}

A clear specification of the algorithm(s) you used and a description
of the main data structures in the implementation. Include a
discussion of any details of the algorithm that were not in the
published paper(s) that formed the basis of your implementation. A
reader should be able to reconstruct and verify your work from reading
your paper.

\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{MyAlgorithm}{$b$}
    \State{$a \gets 10$}
    \EndProcedure{}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \caption{Here is the algorithm.}
\end{algorithm}



\section{Experiments}
Analysis, evaluation, and critique of the algorithm and your
implementation. Include a description of the testing data you used and
a discussion of examples that illustrate major features of your
system. Testing is a critical part of system construction, and the
scope of your testing will be an important component in our
evaluation. Discuss what you learned from the implementation.

\appendix

\section{System Description}

 Appendix 1 – A clear description of how to use your system and how to generate the output you discussed in the write-up. \emph{The teaching staff must be able to run your system.}

\section{Group Makeup}

 Appendix 2 – A list of each project participant and that
participant’s contributions to the project. If the division of work
varies significantly from the project proposal, provide a brief
explanation.  Your code should be clearly documented.
